>@everyone I have identified the root cause of the outages today and it has been permanently fixed
>
>There will be major changes. ZTL and Altare will move closer. Altare will begin using IPs and more services from ZTL. Management will be shared and we will begin offering more paid and enterprise services alongside Altareâ€™s free hosting for extra revenue. This contrasts to the previous system of ZTL being by Altare and just being a subsidiary but a completely separate thing 
>
>Control over Altare & ZTL will more evenly split. Other team members will have access to infrastructure and core assets so that outages like today cannot reoccur 
>
>All new nodes have been deployed. Pending to be added to the dashboard, ETA tomorrow depending on team availability 
>
>gb-cam1 (Cambridge, GB - Regional) is also now available

>Please note that Altare 6 is on schedule, the reset will be completed tomorrow - the new console has finished development and will be privately tested today.
>
>The Asia nodes will not be available while we source a new provider. They will be upgraded to our new standards to ensure decent enough performance.
>
>Karlskrona, SE, Stockholm, SE, Amsterdam, NL, so on will be available, ALL locations on Altare v6 are what we would consider "High Performance - Max" locations by v5 standards. This means they have several hundred GBs of RAM and enough capacity for thousands of servers.
