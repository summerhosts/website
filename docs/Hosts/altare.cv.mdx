<summary>Original message</summary>
>@everyone I have identified the root cause of the outages today and it has been permanently fixed
>
>There will be major changes. ZTL and Altare will move closer. Altare will begin using IPs and more services from ZTL. Management will be shared and we will begin offering more paid and enterprise services alongside Altareâ€™s free hosting for extra revenue. This contrasts to the previous system of ZTL being by Altare and just being a subsidiary but a completely separate thing 
>
>Control over Altare & ZTL will more evenly split. Other team members will have access to infrastructure and core assets so that outages like today cannot reoccur 
>
>All new nodes have been deployed. Pending to be added to the dashboard, ETA tomorrow depending on team availability 
>
>gb-cam1 (Cambridge, GB - Regional) is also now available
