>
>The host will fully migrate from Pterodactyl to Argon and finish the move. All nodes are currently running Krypton already instead of Wings and will not require any downtime to migrate
>
>panel.altare.pro will no longer be available. You will be required to use the dashboard/console from now on, we will re implement schedules there and start introducing new features.
>
>Install times will improve by up to 10x as we switch from the Pterodactyl egg system to Argon Units + Cargo and Radar will now have much deeper control into servers once we update all the nodes to Radar 10
>
>We chose not to announce any of the progress on Argon to make it clear very quickly to our competitors that they're cooked
>

**{new Date(1741825657216).toUTCString()}**  
>All users are being migrated to Argon, please give us another 30 mins

### kurol hired
**{new Date(1742082830635).toUTCString()}**  
kurol was hired for support

### New nodes
**{new Date(1742128466093).toUTCString()}**  
>We expect to launch ~15TB of capacity in Singapore (roughly 30 nodes) and additional capacity elsewhere over the next few days. As compute is available now, resource prices will decrease to make better use of our hardware
>
>The update to Altare is slightly delayed as we want to redesign how deployment works
>The following store prices will go into effect as soon as capacity is deployed:
>
>200 coins per GB RAM
>50 coins per 5GB storage
>175 coins per 100% CPU
>175 coins per server slot
>
>Alongside this, AFK page and rewards rates will increase
>

### Chinese invasion ?
**{new Date(1742138936617).toUTCString()}**  
>Alright, I have had enough of the ongoing Chinese invasion of Altare. I know a solid amount of you people here are Chinese and using our platform to run Nezha + Argo to bypass your country's firewall, I see everything that is happening
>
>I'm kindly asking you all to either leave the host or move to only US-MIA, NL-AMS and US-NYC. These nodes can support your traffic, they aren't blocked by any sites and will be perfect for your usage. Please stop hammering our other nodes with poor network connectivity with VPN traffic
>
>Thank you
>

>I don't care that you are all trying to bypass Radar and obfuscate the code, I understand what the app does. We will disable Radar Nezha detection on those locations so you can all peacefully move over
>Altare understands the intentions behind such activities, we do not care, we simply ask that you move to a location that will not affect us
>

### Alot more capacity coming soon
**{new Date(1742305254002).toUTCString()}**  
>Decreased store prices will officially go into effect later today
>
>Capacity is expected to go from 476GB -> 5.2TB temporarily, we'll expand this to closer to 12TB towards the end of March
>
>Users are recommended to use our new nodes once available, we will announce each one here as they come online
>sg-sgp-3 has capacity for over 1200 servers (as it has 760GB RAM) and sg-sgp-4 can support 2800 servers (1.5TB RAM on machine) 
>This alongside several other new nodes will bring our capacity in line with demand, we expect to need to be able to support roughly ~24,000 online servers by the start of April
>

### Bigass ddos
**{new Date(1742385016897).toUTCString()}**  
>All services are functional again
>
>Yesterday we saw the largest DDoS attack I’ve ever seen in my time in hosting of over 6 years. Despite this, our protection and backend handled it very well. The outage over the last few hours was in fact caused by the dashboard being blocked from accessing the API because it thought it was malicious 
>
>I have no clue what went down this morning, apparently there was a raid but luckily @Ceo (love you 🤍) and @Juixr handled it
>
>There have unfortunately been several coordinated attacks including the use of vulnerabilities in the last 48 hours against Altare. We immediately noticed this and pushed an update to the dashboard, we are currently watching things very closely at the moment
>

### Alot more capacity added
**{new Date(1742403101933).toUTCString()}**  
>**All done, as promised**
>
>We have deployed over 2.2TB of RAM to our Singapore location and upgraded all of the core locations (Mexico City and Tokyo), deployed huge amounts of capacity in the US and introduced a new Frankfurt, DE location
>
>Store prices are **down ~70%**. You can buy a GB of RAM for only 225 coins now, other resource prices have been updated to reflect capacity as well
>
>All new nodes:
>- sg-sgp-3 (770GB RAM ⚡)
>- sg-sgp-4 (1.5TB RAM ⚡)
>- de-fra-1 
>- de-fra-2
>- mx-cmx-2
>- jp-tky-2
>- jp-tky-3
>- us-chi-1
>- us-dal-1 (500GB RAM ⚡)
>- br-sao-1

### Anxiety hits
**{new Date(1742470430649).toUTCString()}**  
> I'm taking a break from running Altare for the next day or two due to my anxiety being pretty bad, currently a bit difficult to function
>
>The next console update will come on the 22nd instead now

### RDPs and VMs are released
**{new Date(1742528467579).toUTCString()}**  
Virtual machines and RDPs (desktop environments that u can connect to) are now available at Altare and are billed hourly with coins. Their resources come in _"presets"_ that cost different amounts of coins/hour and are separate from the resources that you can buy for the store.
>Full virtual machines and RDPs. Now available at Altare.
>
>Billed hourly with coins, full VM performance, support for Linux, macOS and Windows, 10Gbps networking and EPYC CPUs in Singapore
>
>Powered by 3rd-gen Terra, our custom daemon for VMs/RDPs
>![RDPs and VMs announcement image](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/RDPs_VMs_support.png)
>

### RDPs and VMs are put into maintenance
**{new Date(1742572703856).toUTCString()}**  
>Altare's VM platform is being put into maintenance. All VMs will be shut down temporarily
>

**{new Date(1742606418446).toUTCString()}**  
>We are investigating a loss of connectivity within ZTL’s Asia Pacific region and sg-sgp-1/2 being unavailable
>

**{new Date(1742646188597).toUTCString()}**  
>We are investigating a loss of connectivity within ZTL’s MIA1 region and us-mia-1 being unavailable
>

Both of the previous events' ETAs were 45 mins

**{new Date(1742647265780).toUTCString()}**  
>sg-sgp-1 is back
>sg-sgp-2 is back
>

### VMs and RDPs cancelled
**{new Date(1742655309605).toUTCString()}**  
>We will be cancelling the VM/RDP platform
>
>It was a good concept, but due to issues with it and the fact it does not align with our plans, we will be shutting it down. Our focus is on stability with the free hosting service
>

### Web maintenance
**{new Date(1742667713497).toUTCString()}**  
>We are performing emergency maintenance on Altare web infrastructure to migrate to a new machine. This will temporarily affect the console and website
>

**{new Date(1742669287681).toUTCString()}**  
>New machine acquired, moving over now
>

**{new Date(1742670168888).toUTCString()}**  
>All services online. We have moved web infra to Frankfurt
>Rotated API keys and bot tokens
>

**{new Date(1742674424440).toUTCString()}**  
>We made a slight mistake with how authentication works on the dashboard, for a lot of people it may have been stuck loading when you manage a server
>
>It was relying on session data and not pulling the fresh server list. This had been fixed in the past but was rolled back accidentally when we launched VMs 
>

### "Altare is changing direction"
**{new Date(1742684899137).toUTCString()}**  
>**Altare is changing direction**
>
>Today, we have fired the majority of our staff team due to several internal conflicts that took place earlier. From now on, the host will be led by only me and Miłosz (@schizophrenic (cadbdhejxshjwjdjdue  859054888369127454)) for the forseeable future
>
>We believe we have not focused on core features enough, we will be adding subdomains, schedules and other such features as promised to the console over the next few days. We have implemented 20+ security patches to fix vulnerabilities in the console already and will keep going if we find more issues. For now, everything seems secure
>
>VMs will also be fully removed from our platform in the next few hours once the next console update has been pushed. We also moved the API/panel back onto Altare's network (with a Ryzen 9 5900X to power it). We will fully abandon ZTL & Valex and will not rely on them to power our infrastructure in any way
>
>Following this, Altare and ZTL will fully separate into different entities in order to ensure the stability of the host
>

>Since the start of the host, I've developed the console, website, branding and so on by myself, managed all of the infrastructure, paid for the nodes, did support in the beginning, managed the Discord, pretty much everything. Currently, I don't think I need help with this and I can probably do all of it myself again. As such, we are not looking for staff
>
>Miłosz has been with us since 2018 - before I was in hosting. If we do hire anyone, it will be a paid position and you must have been in this industry for at least a few years and know me. This is to ensure the integrity of the host and so our mission remains in line
>
>As of today, roughly 2 weeks after our launch, we are the world's largest free 24/7 host and growing by up to thousand users per day at the peak. Despite this, the host can pretty much operate on it's own with occasional maintenance and support needing to be done thanks to our console actually being very robust (security was pretty much the only issue as we didn't test it much)
>
>We have ran about 100 hosts in the last few years, we understand very well how to operate one, what we haven't been able to do is keep one stable - primarily due to my own issues. We're changing that this time, we have set up Altare with long term operation in mind, we have lots of monitoring, a decent console, stable nodes and so on. If you don't believe me, leave the host and come back in 6 months (:
>

### Location deprecation
**{new Date(1742932778122).toUTCString()}**  
>The following locations are now deprecated and scheduled to be shut down next month:
>* London, GB
>* Nottingham, GB
>* Miami, US
>* Sao Paulo, BR

### lol the tickets
**{new Date(1742986733624).toUTCString()}**  
>Tickets will be resolved today, ETA: 1-2 hours

>

He started sending messages from his normal account on {new Date(1743130485867).toUTCString()}

### Software codenames rebrand
>We are rebranding the codenames of all our products that use Spanish (ex. Heliactyl Next 7.1 - Ceniza) 
>
>New names will be decided tomorrow. The next version of Heliactyl (9th Gen) will use “Namek” 
>

### Discord transition
**{new Date(1743270326875).toUTCString()}**  
>Altare's Discord server will transition to being community based rather than entirely dedicated to the host
>
>We'll be introducing more roles, level rewards for coins and many other things
>
>All of the work for upgrading the Discord server is mostly being done by @C (rtle  601741150705025035), so thank her ❤️
>

**{new Date(1743291524340).toUTCString()}**

### Personal issues
**{new Date(1743300870558).toUTCString()}**  
>Altare update is delayed due to personal issues
>

### Its now a non-profit
**{new Date(1743333635986).toUTCString()}**  
>Altare has finished the transition to a non-profit entity (Altare Foundation)
>
>Due to a lack of on hand funds, the following locations will be shut down on the 1st:
>London, GB
>Miami, US
>All users are required to back up their data if you have servers on gb-lon-1, gb-lon-2, gb-lon-3, us-mia-2
>

>These locations are fairly small and will not affect our total capacity by much
>

### Reset
**{new Date(1743358620436).toUTCString()}**  
A poll was posted with the title `Should it?`

**{new Date(1743358622280).toUTCString()}**  
>**Big decision: should Altare reset?**
>Here's what we've realized:
>- We let resource prices get far too cheap, the economy is pretty much in a collapsed state
>- Our quality control and ability to maintain nodes is slipping
>- The majority of the nodes are overloaded. It's only SGP with an excess amount of capacity (by 2TB...), meaning it has pretty much 0 load (relatively)
>- Whatever else
>
>Please provide your thoughts in #general (1348517539730292778)
>

**{new Date(1743358725960).toUTCString()}**  
>This would mean a full wipe of all nodes, new nodes added to replace some old ones, an upgraded dashboard, all coins, servers & resources reset
>We would announce before it happens. Do not worry
>
>To clarify: we can run the host fine without a reset. But it would be a considerable idea to reset it. So we'll leave it up to you all
>

**{new Date(1743359150978).toUTCString()}**  
>This is literally the problem
>![problem](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/problem.png)
>

>We let this happen
>

**{new Date(1743366977634).toUTCString()}**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>If we don't proceed with the reset, Altare will continue to face increasing problems becoming more unstable. Eventually a reset will be unavoidable or we may be forced to shut down due to our inability to keep up. The logical decision is to reset now and avoid the risk of total data loss and a potential shutdown of Altare.
>We respect your choices and we will not proceed with the reset now if you decide not to.
>

(Another poll was made `Should we reset?`, "yes" won at {new Date(1743371607688).toUTCString()})

>Only negative change after reset will be that we'll put resource limits on the small locations. If you want to run a big server, use Singapore as we have a ton of capacity there, we always will 
>

**{new Date(1743372778657).toUTCString()}**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>Since the majority voted "Yes" we will be proceeding with the reset. Here's what to expect:
>
>- All data on every node will be erased.
>- User resources will be reset to default
>- User coin balances will be set to 0.
>- We will change resource store prices
>- Some nodes will be replaced with new ones.
>- The dashboard will be upgraded.
>
>We will do our best to make sure we don't need to do any more resets.
>

**{new Date(1743372830147).toUTCString()}**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>⚠️ You have 72 hours to backup your data. We will start the reset {formatDistanceToNow(new Date(1743631200 * 1000))}
>

**{new Date(1743390678124).toUTCString()}**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>According to some people the vote is invalid as it was open for only an hour so I am only making another one to prove the result will be the same
>

(Another poll was made `Should we reset?`, "yes" won at {new Date(1743477101401).toUTCString()})

>i should have made the no choice say "no i am completely uncapable of sympathy as i am a diagnosed psychopath and manually editing over a thousand users and servers to make changes is totally acceptable to me"
>would have been way funnier
>

### Database corruption
**{new Date(1743417793380).toUTCString()}**  
>Due to database corruption on the console, servers are not showing for many users
>
>If you can't see your server, please use our backup/secondary panel:
>1. Go to https://panel.altare.pro
>2. Use your **SFTP** username/email and password
>3. Your servers will be there
>
>This is our legacy panel, due to it running Krypton in Pterodactyl Wings imitation mode, many features may be broken but you'll be able to control your server and backup any files
>

**{new Date(1743418129551).toUTCString()}**  
>The timing of this is unfortunate, at this point we don't really have a choice but to reset because of Heliactyl's poor database architecture meaning we can't just use a backup of it
>
>A lot of user data is broken which is making some Altare accounts detatched from their panel side account, so it generates a new one and as such servers are missing. Some users are missing coins or never got AFK rewards due to broken coins balance values
>

### I Love Her
**{new Date(1743452446491).toUTCString()}**
