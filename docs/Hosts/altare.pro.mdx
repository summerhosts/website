### New nodes
**{new Date(1742128466093).toUTCString()}**  
>We expect to launch ~15TB of capacity in Singapore (roughly 30 nodes) and additional capacity elsewhere over the next few days. As compute is available now, resource prices will decrease to make better use of our hardware

>
>200 coins per GB RAM

### Chinese invasion ?
**{new Date(1742138936617).toUTCString()}**  
>Alright, I have had enough of the ongoing Chinese invasion of Altare. I know a solid amount of you people here are Chinese and using our platform to run Nezha + Argo to bypass your country's firewall, I see everything that is happening
>
>I'm kindly asking you all to either leave the host or move to only US-MIA, NL-AMS and US-NYC. These nodes can support your traffic, they aren't blocked by any sites and will be perfect for your usage. Please stop hammering our other nodes with poor network connectivity with VPN traffic
>
>Thank you
>

>I don't care that you are all trying to bypass Radar and obfuscate the code, I understand what the app does. We will disable Radar Nezha detection on those locations so you can all peacefully move over
>Altare understands the intentions behind such activities, we do not care, we simply ask that you move to a location that will not affect us
>

### Alot more capacity coming soon
**{new Date(1742305254002)}**  
>Decreased store prices will officially go into effect later today
>
>Capacity is expected to go from 476GB -> 5.2TB temporarily, we'll expand this to closer to 12TB towards the end of March
>
>Users are recommended to use our new nodes once available, we will announce each one here as they come online
>sg-sgp-3 has capacity for over 1200 servers (as it has 760GB RAM) and sg-sgp-4 can support 2800 servers (1.5TB RAM on machine) 
>This alongside several other new nodes will bring our capacity in line with demand, we expect to need to be able to support roughly ~24,000 online servers by the start of April
>

### Bigass ddos
**{new Date(1742385016897).toUTCString()}**  
>All services are functional again
>
>Yesterday we saw the largest DDoS attack I’ve ever seen in my time in hosting of over 6 years. Despite this, our protection and backend handled it very well. The outage over the last few hours was in fact caused by the dashboard being blocked from accessing the API because it thought it was malicious 
>
>I have no clue what went down this morning, apparently there was a raid but luckily @Ceo (love you 🤍) and @Juixr handled it
>
>There have unfortunately been several coordinated attacks including the use of vulnerabilities in the last 48 hours against Altare. We immediately noticed this and pushed an update to the dashboard, we are currently watching things very closely at the moment
>

### Alot more capacity added

>
>Store prices are **down ~70%**. You can buy a GB of RAM for only 225 coins now, other resource prices have been updated to reflect capacity as well
>
>All new nodes:
>- sg-sgp-3 (770GB RAM ⚡)
