>Please note that Altare 6 is on schedule, the reset will be completed tomorrow - the new console has finished development and will be privately tested today.
>
>The Asia nodes will not be available while we source a new provider. They will be upgraded to our new standards to ensure decent enough performance.
>
>Karlskrona, SE, Stockholm, SE, Amsterdam, NL, so on will be available, ALL locations on Altare v6 are what we would consider "High Performance - Max" locations by v5 standards. This means they have several hundred GBs of RAM and enough capacity for thousands of servers.
