### The music album
**{new Date(1739832451974).toUTCString()}**  
Ether asked *the people* if he should release his music album ("the matt james album"). Majority (6 people as of {new Date(1739905030).toUTCString()}) voted üëç. He said it will come out in april/june cuz he has to finish some songs.
He also said the album was originally meant to be "a load of hating on nayskutzu" but he "abandoned all those songs except 1". The main song is "00:46 am in santiago" (changed from "2:06 am in santiago") and the "good one" is "workplace health concerns"

>@everyone We are going to be changing the way Octant operates from now on
>
>I no longer believe in my principles of how a free host, or how a company should operate. Or just in general, my own principles of how I should act
>
>Due to this, there will be some fairly instant changes in our operations. We will take a more legitimate and morally correct position in the market rather than forcing the maximum growth possible at the cost of our reputation
>
>We are committed to continuing to ship Argon, Krypton, Radar 8 and so on - these releases will take longer due to the previous ETA being extremely short. These products need to be finished before we can launch Octant's free hosting
>

>Octant Cloud Compute is also in the early stages and will be led by @Sabrina Goom
