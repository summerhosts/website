### The music album
**{new Date(1739832451974).toLocaleString()}**  
Ether asked *the people* if he should release his music album ("the matt james album"). Majority (6 people as of {new Date(1739905030).toLocaleString()}) voted üëç. He said it will come out in april/june cuz he has to finish some songs.
He also said the album was originally meant to be "a load of hating on nayskutzu" but he "abandoned all those songs except 1". The main song is "00:46 am in santiago" (changed from "2:06 am in santiago") and the "good one" is "workplace health concerns"

### Octant event ?
**{new Date(1740284081911).toLocaleString()}**  
It was announced that an octant event was happening in a now deleted channel. Later it was also announced that nothing was announced during the event.

### Change of operations
**{new Date(1740330418884).toLocaleString()}**  

Ether announced that:
* he no longer believes in his principles of how a free host, or company should operate
* He no longer believes in his own principles of how he should act
* They will take a more legitimate and morally correct position in the market instead of forcing growth

>@everyone We are going to be changing the way Octant operates from now on
>
>I no longer believe in my principles of how a free host, or how a company should operate. Or just in general, my own principles of how I should act
>
>Due to this, there will be some fairly instant changes in our operations. We will take a more legitimate and morally correct position in the market rather than forcing the maximum growth possible at the cost of our reputation
>
>We are committed to continuing to ship Argon, Krypton, Radar 8 and so on - these releases will take longer due to the previous ETA being extremely short. These products need to be finished before we can launch Octant's free hosting
>

>Octant Cloud Compute is also in the early stages and will be led by @Sabrina Goom

Octant free hosting didn't ship the next day and was delayed with an ETA of < 2 weeks due to not enough capacity.

>While we realise free hosting is necessary to push growth for our other products, we do not want to launch it unless we have enough capacity and there is a solid strategy for it

>We've added our new node, Helios, with 24 threads and 64GB of RAM. You can now deploy to it on the dashboard with the updated node selection!
>
>Moreover, we've implemented some limits to newly created servers:
>- Upto 8GB of RAM

### DDoS
**{new Date(1741318730890).toLocaleString()}**  
The Helios node was DDoSed really hard earlier in the day. This caused an outage.

<details>
<summary>Original message</summary>
>@everyone
>
>**Regarding Recent Events**
>I'd like to address some recent issues affecting our Helios node.
>
>Earlier today, Helios was heavily targeted by a large scale DDoS attack, which disrupted operations and caused issues with local infrastructure (our Helios node is owned hardware). This was a deliberate attack, and we are actively working to mitigate future risks.
>
>Additionally, there have been incidents of personal harassment outside of Octant, which we are taking seriously. I would like to personally assure everybody that despite these setbacks, Octant is **not going anywhere**. We are already planning improvements to security and infrastructure to ensure future stability.
>
>Unfortunately as Helios is our owned hardware, this attack affected me directly as such I was unable to alert other team members of what was going on at the time - we'll shortly be adding +500 coins to everybody that has a server on Helios, and Helios is expected to come back online in the morning (approx. ~8 hours from the time of writing).
