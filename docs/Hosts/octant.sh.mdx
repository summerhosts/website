### The music album
**{new Date(1739832451974).toUTCString()}**  
Ether asked *the people* if he should release his music album ("the matt james album"). Majority (6 people as of {new Date(1739905030).toUTCString()}) voted üëç. He said it will come out in april/june cuz he has to finish some songs.
He also said the album was originally meant to be "a load of hating on nayskutzu" but he "abandoned all those songs except 1". The main song is "00:46 am in santiago" (changed from "2:06 am in santiago") and the "good one" is "workplace health concerns"
