>Hi @everyone,
>
>We will be making some changes over the next few days. My company Metropolis now operates Sryzen alongside the current management. Here's what will be changing:
>
>- Paid users will remain on panel.sryzen.cloud on their current nodes (I am leaving @Yash (1117030742338318346) to deal with them as I am unsure of the exact situation)
>- All free users will be migrated to a new dashboard and panel within the next few days, will start developing it now
>- There will be new branding, design system and the Discord server will be mostly remade
>- New staff members will be appointed from Metropolis' team
>- Default free resources will **increase**, store prices will decrease
>- New locations: Nottingham (GB), Phoenix (US), New York (US), Amsterdam (NL), Marseille (FR), Tokyo (JP), Dallas (US), Singapore Region 2 (SG), Mexico City (MX), London (GB)
>- New domain, US legal entity + we will bring the Mari bot over to handle resources/coins
>
>All of this will be implemented over the next few days (: Thank you for using our services
