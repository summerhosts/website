# What is this
This is a website that aims to document the history of summer hosts, more specifically the ones created by Matt James. 

# What are they
Summer hosts are companies that provide hosting services that only last a few weeks or months. Most of the time the services they offer are free and they have a currency obtained through afking (you basically leave a page open in your browser and gain x coins per minute)

# History
The [history page](./history.md) is a thing. Note that some of the text there is a link so dont hesitate to click on it.
