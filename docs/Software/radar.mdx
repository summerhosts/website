## Info
### Description
This piece of software prevents node abuse by suspending servers that it thinks are abusing.  
What is abuse ? Basically anything that uses node resources for an unintended purpose  
Example: you create a server with the `Minecraft Paper` egg, put [harbor](https://github.com/RealTriassic/Harbor) on it and start hosting a tor node, some torrents, a proxy or something along those lines.  

Radar is closed source and developped by [Ether](../People/Matt%20James.mdx) and his team
