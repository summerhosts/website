## What is this
This is a website that aims to document the history of summer hosts, more specifically the ones created by [Matt James](./people/Matthew%20James.md).

## What are they
Summer hosts are companies that provide hosting services that only last a few weeks or months. Most of the time the services they offer are free and they have a currency obtained through afking (you basically leave a page open in your browser and gain x coins per minute)

## History
