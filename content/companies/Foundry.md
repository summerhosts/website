>@everyone Things have been a little delayed recently as I have a job now and not as much time. Regardless, development is progressing 
>
>To help speed things up, we have formed Foundry, the company that will develop Heliactyl, Radar, Skyport and so on. It’s made of me and Achul, and some people from Altare and Sryzen’s core team, I will also see if Intol would like to help us over there
>
>I believe that at least for now, this will act as the company in between Sryzen and Altare and so that our software can be unified better 
>
>If you would like to have a look: https://discord.gg/SBzm6b89zF

>What we’re also working on is Skyport 2, a completely rewritten version of Skyport/Argon that will truly be a competitor to Pterodactyl and it has a daemon built in Rust and lots of nice upcoming features
