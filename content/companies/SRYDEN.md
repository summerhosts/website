Sryden is a company that offers VPS services, but there are concerns about its credibility. Some people have raised issues about the ownership and management of the company, as well as its business practices. You can read reviews about Sryden on Trustpilot to learn more.

There have been accusations that Sryden's operations are run by inexperienced individuals who are only interested in making a quick profit. There are also allegations of the company using free tier VPS services and potentially engaging in fraudulent activities such as carding and abusing SEPA methods. Furthermore, there have been reports of Sryden being involved in crypto scams.

Sryden has a history of experiencing significant downtimes, which may be linked to their use of AWS services without paying for them. Some speculate that Sryden has been taking advantage of free trial offers without paying for the service when it expires, resulting in AWS not responding to their support requests.

In addition, there have been complaints about Sryden selling VPS services that have been abused and terminated due to misuse by some users. As a result, legitimate users were also impacted and faced service suspension without any refunds.

Overall, it is advisable to exercise caution when dealing with Sryden due to the aforementioned concerns
