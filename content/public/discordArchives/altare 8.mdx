> **Services are currently unstable**
> 
> Cloudflare is currently consistently having outages across locations and it's affecting us and most of the Internet. Altare was directly hit by the Aisuru botnet yesterday, and we saw the same behaviour where it started returning 500 for the location or saying the site is rate limited. A good guess is that the botnet is now targeting Cloudflare's network directly.

> Several new locations have arrived, including several within the EU, and Singapore is here. 🇸🇬

> We've added Pockets, Savings and Staking back, we've improved the Wallet UI a bit.
> And we have also added back Referrals, fixed the AFK page & party mode, added back streaks for Daily Rewards.
> 
> Altare's Arc 4 mini model is now available in the file editor allowing you to ask it to edit things for you and help you build your server with the help of AI. And autocomplete is also there, so you can do things faster.
> 
> The console is also a lot faster and more stable, we've updated our software a bit and made things more stable. The server creation wizard was completely redesigned, and you can now see the nodes that we have and their load. And you can view that on the console page too now.

> **Altare’s node capacity to increase by 246%, economy and pricing changes + thank you for 4000 members**
> 
> By Nov 25, the node count will increase from 30 to what we expect to be 104-110. At minimum, this will be a 246% increase. To compensate, all users will have their default resources changed to 8GB RAM, 400% CPU, 2 server slots. In the future, if we run out of capacity and scale up fast enough, new users may receive 4GB again
> 
> AFK page & referrals earnings will increase, store prices will decrease slightly
> 
> Bundles, packages & coupons will be introduced. To ensure we still remain profitable, resources will be limited at 24GB RAM (across teams), you can pay $5.99 to remove it. A few other things will be added while making our economy better and easier to earn for free at the same time, and our anti alt will get better to prevent abuse and users transferring their coins to other accounts
> 
> We will also launch capacity for users from specific regions, ex. users from Russia/Belarus will be able to use a Moscow location and will be limited to that. And they’ll be served by different legal policies and have slightly different features. The same will be for a few other countries
> 
> And thank you for 4K members, Altare’s Discord has been quite stagnant in the last month and we seem to finally be growing here again, likely because our user growth has gone up significantly with Altare 8

> We are also adding a few new ways to earn credits which I will not mention yet until the v8.2 release announcement
