>I don't care if you all hate me and leave Altare, I disagree with everything currently going on
>
>I'm not leaving her, I don't care what happens, I don't know if I've made it clear enough:
>1. The existence of Altare is literally because of her. Do you all not realise how much she helps me in regards to my mental issues? I break down pretty often, don't you all think it's strange that it never ends up with Altare collapsing like what happened at XEH and prior
>2. Regarding the nudes, it was literally one time and we both realised it was a bad idea. We are also both minors, and it's also not you lads' issue...
>3. How exactly is she a gold digger? I've spent about 20 euros on her in total
>4. We both act very much different in Altare vs in private, I fail to see what basis you all use for saying she's such an awful person
>
>I'm not happy that you all are trying to dictate my relationship and say "val was better" because it's not true imo. This is a fucking host, why do you all care about this so much? I give you all free servers and a community, that's it

>Tell me how she's the one with the big ego, I literally act like an evil Nazi dictator that runs the hosting industry. You all don't complain about me

>You're all only acting in your own interests, you prefered Val because she was from the same industry. Just fuck off for once and leave this to me

>Stop assuming things and get away from my relationship. What is the point of protesting? We provide our services for free. I'm fine as I am, stop protesting and doing this shit supposedly for me

### The Purge
At around 1744720929902 Ether started deleting channels. Only a few public channels remained.
Around 9 people were banned.
![the channel purge](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/2/after_channel_purge.png)

### The End
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744753549852" />**  
An embed was sent in all of the channels by the altare bot:
>@everyone
>#### EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT
>⚠️ URGENT: Altare systems will be shutting down soon. Please immediately backup all your important data to avoid permanent loss.
>_This is an official Altare announcement.• <DateDisplay timestamp="1744753549852" />_
>
About 64 pings were sent. Then Ether sent a message in announcements

<DateDisplay timestamp="1744753918986" />  
>really didnt need to go for every single channel but that works i guess alright
>i'm sure our members will appreciate the 64 pings
>
>thank schizophrenic/milosz for the announcements
>
>i'll be around elsewhere if anyone needs me
>

The End.

>Services have remained somewhat stable for the last month despite my laziness and lack of time. Unfortunately, all of the drama has very much demotivated me but I am committed to keeping Altare alive. I hope you can all forgive me for not managing the host very well this month, I'm sorry

>I'm taking a break for a while, I won't be around. I'm focusing on other projects and my life for now. I'll work on refining our products (Heliactyl, Radar, so on) in the mean time and bringing the quality back up and sorting out any conflict within my side of people
>
>*How did Altare exist?*
>
>The unfortunate truth is that we didn't pay for any of our nodes. A good amount of people know this and still follow us after all these hosts. This is the only reason we can provide such good free hosting, we don't have any costs
>
>We can't really maintain the nodes anymore and keep them stable unfortunately, it was difficult enough trying to keep data backed up with 20+ nodes at old Altare
>
>All capacity has been turned off except the current existing nodes. Altare will stay operational for the forseeable future but I won't be touching it much I'll just make sure the platform works. If I can't, I'll hand everything over to one of the other members of Altare's remaining team
>
>*The hosting industry*
>
>I joined the industry in 2020, almost 5 years ago. A lot has changed since then, but it's become extremely competitive in recent years. We've struggled to keep up, we developed Heliactyl Next for the reason of trying to be ahead and have been successful at it. Yet again, here we are falling behind

>I don't really have much time or motivation for everything unfortunately, I've done this for long enough I don't really care what the rest of the market thinks of us, or what our reputation is. I just like running a community

### Here, have a host
At some point the server was handed over to Samuel [ `samcothepug`  `220849580923813898` ]. All staff was demoted, non essential roles were deleted and the dashboard was replaced with [shadow's dash](https://shadowsdash.com/) and the panel became pterodactyl. [New (free) nodes](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/new_nodes.jpg), a [few server types](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/new_server_creation.png) and [NSFW ads](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/nsfw_ads.png) got added.
