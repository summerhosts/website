### Altare maintenance
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1741818583971" />**  
>**Service maintenance**
>
>Altare will be unavailable from <RelativeDateDisplay timestamp="1741823940000"> / <DateDisplay timestamp="1741823940000" /> to <DateDisplay timestamp="1741838340000" />
>
>The host will fully migrate from Pterodactyl to Argon and finish the move. All nodes are currently running Krypton already instead of Wings and will not require any downtime to migrate
>
>panel.altare.pro will no longer be available. You will be required to use the dashboard/console from now on, we will re implement schedules there and start introducing new features.
>
>Install times will improve by up to 10x as we switch from the Pterodactyl egg system to Argon Units + Cargo and Radar will now have much deeper control into servers once we update all the nodes to Radar 10
>
>We chose not to announce any of the progress on Argon to make it clear very quickly to our competitors that they're cooked
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1741825657216" />**  
>All users are being migrated to Argon, please give us another 30 mins
>Finished
>Turning panel off
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1741827045435" />**  
>**Maintenance complete**
>
>We have finished the migration from Pterodactyl to Argon, it has gone as planned with no issues. We also fixed a few bugs, moved edit resources & delete and added a few features
>
>panel.altare.pro is no longer available as we no longer use Pterodactyl, please use the console/dashboard
>![dashboard preview](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/dashboard_preview_2.png)

### console & API moving to a new machine
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1741967264742" />**  
>We will be performing maintenance on the console & API to move it to a new machine
>
>This will resolve all of the performance issues. It may go down for a short amount of time during the next hour
>The migration will improve avg API response times from ~4.5 seconds to \<20ms

Migration completed

### New nodes
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1741975310787" />**  
Singapore and Chile nodes were added

### Dashboard things
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742037775776" />**  
>We’re investigating issues with the dashboard, please wait
>
>Unfortunately I was asleep, I’m still in bed so I need 10 mins to get up before I can have a look
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742046358673" />**  
>Outage was caused by a memory leak in the dashboard, it has been fixed
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742053811271" />**  
>Dashboard is being moved to a new machine
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742080821972" />**  
> Apologies for the outage with the main website, it has been fixed
>
>Tomorrow, we'll launch subdomains a few other nice features (:
>Deployment demand is currently high in Singapore and Tokyo, please use other locations when possible
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742082830635" />**  
kurol was hired for support

### New bigass nodes
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742128466093" />**  
>We expect to launch ~15TB of capacity in Singapore (roughly 30 nodes) and additional capacity elsewhere over the next few days. As compute is available now, resource prices will decrease to make better use of our hardware
>
>The update to Altare is slightly delayed as we want to redesign how deployment works
>The following store prices will go into effect as soon as capacity is deployed:
>
>200 coins per GB RAM
>50 coins per 5GB storage
>175 coins per 100% CPU
>175 coins per server slot
>
>Alongside this, AFK page and rewards rates will increase
>

### Chinese invasion ?
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742138936617" />**  
>Alright, I have had enough of the ongoing Chinese invasion of Altare. I know a solid amount of you people here are Chinese and using our platform to run Nezha + Argo to bypass your country's firewall, I see everything that is happening
>
>I'm kindly asking you all to either leave the host or move to only US-MIA, NL-AMS and US-NYC. These nodes can support your traffic, they aren't blocked by any sites and will be perfect for your usage. Please stop hammering our other nodes with poor network connectivity with VPN traffic
>
>Thank you
>

>I don't care that you are all trying to bypass Radar and obfuscate the code, I understand what the app does. We will disable Radar Nezha detection on those locations so you can all peacefully move over
>Altare understands the intentions behind such activities, we do not care, we simply ask that you move to a location that will not affect us
>

### Alot more capacity coming soon
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742305254002" />**  
>Decreased store prices will officially go into effect later today
>
>Capacity is expected to go from 476GB -> 5.2TB temporarily, we'll expand this to closer to 12TB towards the end of March
>
>Users are recommended to use our new nodes once available, we will announce each one here as they come online
>sg-sgp-3 has capacity for over 1200 servers (as it has 760GB RAM) and sg-sgp-4 can support 2800 servers (1.5TB RAM on machine) 
>This alongside several other new nodes will bring our capacity in line with demand, we expect to need to be able to support roughly ~24,000 online servers by the start of April
>

### Bigass ddos
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742385016897" />**  
>All services are functional again
>
>Yesterday we saw the largest DDoS attack I’ve ever seen in my time in hosting of over 6 years. Despite this, our protection and backend handled it very well. The outage over the last few hours was in fact caused by the dashboard being blocked from accessing the API because it thought it was malicious 
>
>I have no clue what went down this morning, apparently there was a raid but luckily @Ceo (love you 🤍) and @Jaixr handled it
>
>There have unfortunately been several coordinated attacks including the use of vulnerabilities in the last 48 hours against Altare. We immediately noticed this and pushed an update to the dashboard, we are currently watching things very closely at the moment
>

### Bigass added
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742403101933" />**  
>**All done, as promised**
>
>We have deployed over 2.2TB of RAM to our Singapore location and upgraded all of the core locations (Mexico City and Tokyo), deployed huge amounts of capacity in the US and introduced a new Frankfurt, DE location
>
>Store prices are **down ~70%**. You can buy a GB of RAM for only 225 coins now, other resource prices have been updated to reflect capacity as well
>
>All new nodes:
>- sg-sgp-3 (770GB RAM ⚡)
>- sg-sgp-4 (1.5TB RAM ⚡)
>- de-fra-1 
>- de-fra-2
>- mx-cmx-2
>- jp-tky-2
>- jp-tky-3
>- us-chi-1
>- us-dal-1 (500GB RAM ⚡)
>- br-sao-1

### Anxiety hits
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742470430649" />**  
> I'm taking a break from running Altare for the next day or two due to my anxiety being pretty bad, currently a bit difficult to function
>
>The next console update will come on the 22nd instead now

### RDPs and VMs are released
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742528467579" />**  
Virtual machines and RDPs (desktop environments that u can connect to) are now available at Altare and are billed hourly with coins. Their resources come in _"presets"_ that cost different amounts of coins/hour and are separate from the resources that you can buy for the store.
>Full virtual machines and RDPs. Now available at Altare.
>
>Billed hourly with coins, full VM performance, support for Linux, macOS and Windows, 10Gbps networking and EPYC CPUs in Singapore
>
>Powered by 3rd-gen Terra, our custom daemon for VMs/RDPs
>![RDPs and VMs announcement image](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/RDPs_VMs_support.png)
>

### RDPs and VMs are put into maintenance
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742572703856" />**  
>Altare's VM platform is being put into maintenance. All VMs will be shut down temporarily
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742606418446" />**  
>We are investigating a loss of connectivity within ZTL’s Asia Pacific region and sg-sgp-1/2 being unavailable
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742646188597" />**  
>We are investigating a loss of connectivity within ZTL’s MIA1 region and us-mia-1 being unavailable
>

Both of the previous events' ETAs were 45 mins

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742647265780" />**  
>sg-sgp-1 is back
>sg-sgp-2 is back
>

### VMs and RDPs cancelled
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742655309605" />**  
>We will be cancelling the VM/RDP platform
>
>It was a good concept, but due to issues with it and the fact it does not align with our plans, we will be shutting it down. Our focus is on stability with the free hosting service
>

### Web maintenance
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742667713497" />**  
>We are performing emergency maintenance on Altare web infrastructure to migrate to a new machine. This will temporarily affect the console and website
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742669287681" />**  
>New machine acquired, moving over now
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742670168888" />**  
>All services online. We have moved web infra to Frankfurt
>Rotated API keys and bot tokens
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742674424440" />**  
>We made a slight mistake with how authentication works on the dashboard, for a lot of people it may have been stuck loading when you manage a server
>
>It was relying on session data and not pulling the fresh server list. This had been fixed in the past but was rolled back accidentally when we launched VMs 
>

### "Altare is changing direction"
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742684899137" />**  
>**Altare is changing direction**
>
>Today, we have fired the majority of our staff team due to several internal conflicts that took place earlier. From now on, the host will be led by only me and Miłosz (@schizophrenic (cadbdhejxshjwjdjdue  859054888369127454)) for the forseeable future
>
>We believe we have not focused on core features enough, we will be adding subdomains, schedules and other such features as promised to the console over the next few days. We have implemented 20+ security patches to fix vulnerabilities in the console already and will keep going if we find more issues. For now, everything seems secure
>
>VMs will also be fully removed from our platform in the next few hours once the next console update has been pushed. We also moved the API/panel back onto Altare's network (with a Ryzen 9 5900X to power it). We will fully abandon ZTL & Valex and will not rely on them to power our infrastructure in any way
>
>Following this, Altare and ZTL will fully separate into different entities in order to ensure the stability of the host
>

>Since the start of the host, I've developed the console, website, branding and so on by myself, managed all of the infrastructure, paid for the nodes, did support in the beginning, managed the Discord, pretty much everything. Currently, I don't think I need help with this and I can probably do all of it myself again. As such, we are not looking for staff
>
>Miłosz has been with us since 2018 - before I was in hosting. If we do hire anyone, it will be a paid position and you must have been in this industry for at least a few years and know me. This is to ensure the integrity of the host and so our mission remains in line
>
>As of today, roughly 2 weeks after our launch, we are the world's largest free 24/7 host and growing by up to thousand users per day at the peak. Despite this, the host can pretty much operate on it's own with occasional maintenance and support needing to be done thanks to our console actually being very robust (security was pretty much the only issue as we didn't test it much)
>
>We have ran about 100 hosts in the last few years, we understand very well how to operate one, what we haven't been able to do is keep one stable - primarily due to my own issues. We're changing that this time, we have set up Altare with long term operation in mind, we have lots of monitoring, a decent console, stable nodes and so on. If you don't believe me, leave the host and come back in 6 months (:
>

### Location deprecation
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742932778122" />**  
>The following locations are now deprecated and scheduled to be shut down next month:
>* London, GB
>* Nottingham, GB
>* Miami, US
>* Sao Paulo, BR

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1742986733624" />**  
>Tickets will be resolved today, ETA: 1-2 hours
>![ticketz](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/tickets.png)

He started sending messages from his normal account on <DateDisplay timestamp="1743130485867" />

### Software codenames rebrand
>We are rebranding the codenames of all our products that use Spanish (ex. Heliactyl Next 7.1 - Ceniza) 
>
>New names will be decided tomorrow. The next version of Heliactyl (9th Gen) will use “Namek” 
>

### Discord server transition
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743270326875" />**  
>Altare's Discord server will transition to being community based rather than entirely dedicated to the host
>
>We'll be introducing more roles, level rewards for coins and many other things
>
>All of the work for upgrading the Discord server is mostly being done by @C (rtle  601741150705025035), so thank her ❤️
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743291524340" />**  
>We‘ve added some Community roles.

### Personal issues
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743300870558" />**  
>Altare update is delayed due to personal issues
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743333635986" />**  
>Altare has finished the transition to a non-profit entity (Altare Foundation)
>
>Due to a lack of on hand funds, the following locations will be shut down on the 1st:
>London, GB
>Miami, US
>All users are required to back up their data if you have servers on gb-lon-1, gb-lon-2, gb-lon-3, us-mia-2
>

>These locations are fairly small and will not affect our total capacity by much
>

### Reset
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743358620436" />**  
A poll was posted with the title `Should it?`

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743358622280" />**  
>**Big decision: should Altare reset?**
>Here's what we've realized:
>- We let resource prices get far too cheap, the economy is pretty much in a collapsed state
>- Our quality control and ability to maintain nodes is slipping
>- The majority of the nodes are overloaded. It's only SGP with an excess amount of capacity (by 2TB...), meaning it has pretty much 0 load (relatively)
>- Whatever else
>
>Please provide your thoughts in #general (1348517539730292778)
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743358725960" />**  
>This would mean a full wipe of all nodes, new nodes added to replace some old ones, an upgraded dashboard, all coins, servers & resources reset
>We would announce before it happens. Do not worry
>
>To clarify: we can run the host fine without a reset. But it would be a considerable idea to reset it. So we'll leave it up to you all
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743359150978" />**  
>This is literally the problem
>![problem](https://summerhosts.github.io/media/altare/1/problem.png)
>

>We let this happen
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743366977634" />**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>If we don't proceed with the reset, Altare will continue to face increasing problems becoming more unstable. Eventually a reset will be unavoidable or we may be forced to shut down due to our inability to keep up. The logical decision is to reset now and avoid the risk of total data loss and a potential shutdown of Altare.
>We respect your choices and we will not proceed with the reset now if you decide not to.
>

(Another poll was made `Should we reset?`, "yes" won at <DateDisplay timestamp="1743371607688" />)

>Only negative change after reset will be that we'll put resource limits on the small locations. If you want to run a big server, use Singapore as we have a ton of capacity there, we always will 
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743372778657" />**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>Since the majority voted "Yes" we will be proceeding with the reset. Here's what to expect:
>
>- All data on every node will be erased.
>- User resources will be reset to default
>- User coin balances will be set to 0.
>- We will change resource store prices
>- Some nodes will be replaced with new ones.
>- The dashboard will be upgraded.
>
>We will do our best to make sure we don't need to do any more resets.
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743372830147" />**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>⚠️ You have 72 hours to backup your data. We will start the reset <RelativeDateDisplay timestamp="1743631200000">

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743390678124" />**  
_from @schizophrenic_
>According to some people the vote is invalid as it was open for only an hour so I am only making another one to prove the result will be the same
>

(Another poll was made `Should we reset?`, "yes" won at <DateDisplay timestamp="1743477101401" />)

_from @schizophrenic_

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743391419614" />**  
>i should have made the no choice say "no i am completely uncapable of sympathy as i am a diagnosed psychopath and manually editing over a thousand users and servers to make changes is totally acceptable to me"
>would have been way funnier
>

### Database corruption
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743417793380" />**  
>Due to database corruption on the console, servers are not showing for many users
>
>If you can't see your server, please use our backup/secondary panel:
>1. Go to https://panel.altare.pro
>2. Use your **SFTP** username/email and password
>3. Your servers will be there
>
>This is our legacy panel, due to it running Krypton in Pterodactyl Wings imitation mode, many features may be broken but you'll be able to control your server and backup any files
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743418129551" />**  
>The timing of this is unfortunate, at this point we don't really have a choice but to reset because of Heliactyl's poor database architecture meaning we can't just use a backup of it
>
>A lot of user data is broken which is making some Altare accounts detatched from their panel side account, so it generates a new one and as such servers are missing. Some users are missing coins or never got AFK rewards due to broken coins balance values
>

### I Love Her
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743452446491" />**  
>To clarify, she is my gf and I love her. Seriously one of the most amazing people I’ve met, she’s staying with me & in Altare’s management permanently

### Console changelog
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743456484222" />**  
>**Altare console update**
>
>We finally updated the console:
>- Updated backend to Heliactyl Next 9 (Namek)
>- Removed VMs, billing
>- Refined UI a bit
>- Fixed some issues with files and plugins
>- Fixed WS connection issues
>- Added backend for subdomains system (available soon)
>- Changed legal info
>- Fixed performance issues (mostly)
>- Fixed several security issues
>- Added love messages to the source code
>- Fixed deployment issues

### April fools
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743505765020" />**  
>**Altare has been acquired by Aternos**
>
>Today, Aternos GmbH has acquired Altare Global IBC. As per instructions from their team, the following changes will be implemented:
>- SFTP will be removed
>- Servers will now shut down after 5 minutes of inactivity
>- All locations will be removed except Dallas
>- The UI will experience a process called “enshittification”

Reset reminder by 3z4k (.3z.4k., 1242809475648196681)

### Reset started

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743628839120" />**  
>@here All services will be back online tomorrow once the reset is done
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743674687604" />**  
>@here We are working on it
>

>We need to replace our web infrastructure first which may take some time, expect services to be up later
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743684762728" />**  
>@everyone All services are back online
>
>For now, we have only deployed the Singapore location. This is because the bulk of our capacity is there, we will slowly re introduce all the other locations once they have been upgraded
>
>We are trying to avoid a situation where some locations are overloaded due to lack of resources, we want stable load across all regions & nodes
>

>We'll announce over the next few hours/days as other locations return
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743685165481" />**  
>Fixed AFK page

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743702406650" />**  
>@everyone
>
>**What just happened**
>
>We have unfortunately lost our infrastructure in Singapore and several other locations. This is because Altare has been terminated from 4 of our upstreams in the timespan of a day due to abuse, primarily caused by Radar being out of production and insufficient to do the job of protecting the nodes. As such, there has been a huge amount of malicious use on the Altare platform
>
>We are grateful that it happened at this time while everyone has backups. We're sorry for disappointing everyone, we are going to have to switch out a lot of the nodes
>
>Expected service recovery time is \<2h
>
>Unfortunately, I develop and operate the host entirely by myself, I own and maintain the console, website, panel, nodes and so on. It's currently getting difficult and tiring to develop Radar and all of the side products that we need to operate the host. The host is also a constant burning ship that needs putting out 24/7 because of our scale and the fact we're literally the largest free 24/7 host
>
>I apologize for thinking I could run this by myself and such has had the consequence of the console being unstable and slow a lot of the time, nodes going down and so on. I spend the majority of my time fixing the host because of this
>
>We will hire more people to Altare's operational team over the next few days to improve reliability. We are committed to keeping Altare running well
>

>||I also thank [@C](../../people/Chelsea.md) for being here, I'd be dead from my anxiety by now, I really love her if it's not obvious enough (:||
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743704573155" />**  
>Back in February, I promised everyone a host that would stay permanently, would be stable and have great performance and support
>
>I believe we've delivered on this - we have thousands of users, yet we've kept our infrastructure mostly stable and performant. Our console has issues sometimes but that's pretty much it
>
>I see no reason of slowing down here, we'll sort out the capacity loss and continue from where we were
>
>Thank you for using Altare
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743763390413" />**  
>@here Services will be online again today, we have acquired new capacity
>

>We apologise for the outage and we don’t expect anything like this to happen in the future
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743777856654" />**  
>@everyone All services are back online
>
>We had to reset the console once again as we lost the previous database, apologies. Currently available in Tokyo, will add more locations later
>

>I slightly decreased resource prices by 100 or so as well
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743844154026" />**  
>@here Since the console is still unstable, we are bringing back the panel and will make it an additional feature again soon & we’ll theme it
>
>Later today if I have time, more locations and software types will also launch
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743844250217" />**  
>The issue is primarily Pterodactyl 
>
>We will admit that we haven’t been running Argon, we have only used Krypton + Wings. Unfortunately the panel isn’t really complete yet and we couldn’t move, Argon is still expected to be finished by May 2025
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743844932751" />**  
>I’m out for the majority of today so don’t expect many updates please but we’ll sort all of this out. We want Altare to support every single game and discord bot that we can physically add support for
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743882622939" />**  
>We also have an actual staff team now for the Discord, it used to be that we only had the operations team and that’s it
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1743933796997" />**  
>Altare is now the largest free server host in several countries within South America
>
>We are slowly making our way into the regular free host market, we’re already the largest free 24/7 host globally

>Apologies for lack of node availability, as per the all mighty queen [@C](../../people/Chelsea.md)’s instructions, we shall deploy new nodes today

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744026545848" />**  
>@here We do not intend to deploy any infrastructure in Singapore. This is due to a shortage of available capacity and on-hand funds
>
>The redeployment of other locations & nodes has been postponed due to lack of time
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744056659943" />**  
>@here Unfortunately, we do not expect to have node availability sorted today
>
>Please understand that Altare is currently facing internal issues, we apologise for this but it will be sorted in the next 2-3 days
>Due to the collapse of our side company ZTL, we cannot offer enterprise services + nodes in NYC, AMS, LON will be removed from our plans for now

### Warsaw, PL capacity
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744140441091" />**  
>@everyone
>
>**We're back** - now with capacity in Warsaw, PL
>
>Capacity will continue to scale back up to how it was over the next day or two, 20+ nodes will be set up (still no Singapore unfortunately though)
>

>c2-tko4, c2-tko5 at some point soon, then we'll re enable Tokyo, JP too

### Argon stuff
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744125526714" />**  
>@here It seems that Pterodactyl panel yolks aren't really being updated anymore
>
>If you own a host like we do and need newer images, you can switch to Argon images
>`ghcr.io/argon-foss/images:java_23`
>`ghcr.io/argon-foss/images:nodejs_22`
>

>Since it looks like no one at Pterodactyl cares anymore, you can use our images with Pterodactyl and they work fine: https://github.com/argon-foss/images
>
>Our repo is forked from pterodactyl/yolks fyi
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744196056563" />**  
>@everyone Our replacement for Pterodactyl, Argon is coming. If you want to have a look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhyxKJBMdik

### Staffing up
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744409589637" />**  
>@everyone
>
>Altare Global IBC (since our Discord community is separate to the host, we use this in the context of the company/host itself) will undergo restructuring due to financial concerns and management issues 
>
>We plan to construct a new board (what we call the consortium) and fix the lack of operations team to ensure service stability
>
>We currently have 51 nodes online but only 4 are actually set up, we apologise for this mismanagement and the inconvenience caused by it 
>
>Console updates will continue per previously as usual as soon as possible since there hasn’t been a new update deployed in over a week 
>
>Apologies for issues, we will fix this as soon as possible
>

>Heliactyl Next 10 exists now, but Altare has not received it yet due to Altare’s changes still not being ported to it, we apologise for this as well
>

>We actually have more on hand capacity than we did when we had the Singapore nodes (7.64 TB vs 3.76 TB)
>
>However, none of it is deployed due to lack of time, no team and the fact it takes ages to set up our monitoring system so Altare’s backend doesn’t complain. So we couldn’t be bothered
>

>We expected a full switch to native Argon by now and we planned to deploy all the nodes then. But Argon has not reached 1.0 and the ETA is the end of April
>
>We cancelled this plan and will stay with Heliactyl Next since it’s more stable and the platform is significantly more developed
>

### Apologies
**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744586090350" />**  
>@everyone
>
>I have realised the absolute state that I’ve let Altare, Argon/Krypton, Heliactyl Next, Radar and all of our other products get into. I am sorry for my mismanagement and laziness, I have had close to no motivation towards anything for most of this year and it’s been quite obvious by the decline in our innovation and how far the quality of everything has fallen 
>
>There’s no longer any team behind everything, I’ve fired everyone or let them resign. We can’t find anyone because no one is willing to work for us anymore after XEH, Altare’s community does not have any staff that have sufficient knowledge to work at the company itself unfortunately 
>
>The realistic truth is that Altare’s continued existence despite the fact our hosts usually last less than a month is because of my extremely elevated self worth, whatever sort of power trip this host gives me and because of a certain someone making me feel good. We do not have any business strategy and the host hasn’t really been maintained in weeks
>
>I will try and do my best to maintain everything, I have sole ownership of Altare’s company and it’s the primary reason I haven’t been forced out by now
>
>I announced Altare v2 earlier, apologies for disappointing everyone but I don’t have any of it done, I intended to throw the whole thing together in one night like I did with the original Altare release but I don’t think it will work so well, our backend (Heliactyl Next) is aging and has security issues and isn’t very fast or stable 
>
>I’ll figure it out from here, apologies for the amount of things we’ve promised and not delivered on and the nodes’ deployment constantly being pushed back 
>
>I apologise for the power trip I’ve had for the last month and my inability to recognise my mismanagement of everything
>

**<DateDisplay timestamp="1744588634334" />**  
>You can all thank the current existence of Altare on [@C](../../people/Chelsea.md) pretty much, I love her as always ❤️
>
>XEH, Pluto, Fractal, so on was sold because I broke down and erratically decided to get rid of the host, it hasn't happened here because she keeps me feeling good enough to not do so. In most other cases when I realise I've mismanaged this I probably would've just resigned or sold the host
