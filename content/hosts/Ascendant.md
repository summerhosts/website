## History

### Host announcements

_ethzr (ethzr, `287810414094450699`)_
> @everyone Ascendant’s hosting is launching before Christmas at latest 
> 
> **Technical things:**
> 
> We have completely dropped Pterodactyl, Cryogenic, Docker. I have been working on an entirely new truly all in one dashboard that will be Heliactyl Next 16
> 
> We have brought back Argon’s Krypton daemon, but rewritten in Rust and with a new Krypton container engine that directly bypasses Docker and uses containerd. We see significant speed improvements following this, our only goal is to make Ascendant the world’s fastest free host. We are no longer using WebSockets or a regular REST API, we are using a newer version of our FQTT (similar to MQTT) protocol. Previously we had to drop it due to issues in production, but we have brought it back with a new Firestorm 2 FQTT broker/client. We prefer this protocol as it has much less overhead than a normal WS 
> 
> We are also now using Crucible 1.0 as our reverse proxy & webserver, it’s much faster than 0.4, has better caching, significantly stronger Flux, and it directly hooks into our dashboard

_ethzr (ethzr, `287810414094450699`)_
> We also changed how our UI works significantly, rather than being entirely client side and being slow, we are using SSR and injecting data prior to load. This means there are no more spinners and slow loading times, this is much closer to older Heliactyl but without ditching Vite/React

> And we have also made the world’s fastest SSH client/server by completely dropping SSH itself and running everything over FQTT

### no new hardware

> I planned for the return of our Nottingham location with new hardware, much more capacity and some significant changes. However, this has been cancelled. This is due to the absolutely disastrous RAM prices at the moment. In no way can we afford to do this, as all of our hardware requires upgrading. We will bring the location back as a lot of people liked it but at low capacity. We wanted to have 14 brand new machines to replace the current ones, but this isn’t feasible, especially as some hardware would be AM5 with DDR5 and the prices for DDR5 are even worse
> 
> Due to the fact the AI market has bought up literally the whole global RAM supply, and will keep doing so, likely to an even further extent, we don’t expect to be able to do this any time soon until the AI bubble pops, and with it the global economy. Isn’t this wonderful
