>After Altare, we no longer run dual Argon Krypton and Pterodactyl Wings in production for both panels. We now use a custom Rust based daemon forked from github.com/0x7d8/wings-rs. We merged a lot of Next 10's functionality that previously relied on Pterodactyl's API to natively use the daemon

>We call this daemon Cryogenic, it will become the standard daemon that is used with Pterodactyl + Heliactyl Next
