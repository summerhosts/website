### Less time and a new company
Ether made a new company called Foundry that will develop software. This was announced in the Sryzen discord server and Altare's discord server.

<details>
<summary>Original Message</summary>

**{new Date(1760977733080).toLocaleString()}**  

>@everyone
>
>- *The latest news from Altare's open source software & AI company, Foundry*
>
>Skyport `panel@2.0.0` and `skyportd@2.0.0` will be joining Radar 15, Heliactyl Next 15 (and Cryogenic 15), Arc 4 next month
>
>We aren't entirely there yet, but skyportd 2 is complete. It will replace Argon and Skyport 0.x as the true replacement for Pterodactyl. skyportd now works seamlessly with Heliactyl Next, Pterodactyl and Skyport. Everything is unified and will work together
>
>Skyport 2 inherits the Units system from Argon, now with Units v4, but now with the new skyportd daemon built in Rust for much better stability. And it also comes with perfect 1:1 support for Pterodactyl eggs, Pelican eggs, Argon v2/v3 Units and Skyport 0.x images
>
>- *Skyport 2 vs Pterodactyl*
>
>Skyport has a much better, faster and more stable daemon. A new unified client & application API built from the ground up, with the legacy Pterodactyl compatible API too. Better monitoring, statistics for nodes. Built in (optional) Radar 15 for anti abuse. A better, easier to use frontend, a much faster and easier to scale backend built in TypeScript.
>
>- *What happens at Altare*
>
>Altare 8 is planned, and will make the move to Skyport and Heliactyl Next 15 as promised. Everything is on schedule for November. It will happen. All of our poor performance problems will be gone thanks to the full rewrite of the console (that runs Next 15). You'll all have a much better experience after this
>

**{new Date(1760961803319).toLocaleString()}**  
>This means that by Altare 8, we will be running entirely Altare built software with close to nothing external
>

</details>

Ether also said he was probably going to take a step back from working on Altare.

>@everyone

>besides this:
>
>I'm probably taking a step back from working on Altare. A lot has been going on recently, and I've been mainly focusing on upgrading our stack of software and making it open source in order to resolve the frequent issues people experience
>
>Since the host began last year I've been the one that designs everything, maintains the console and all of the nodes and it's quite time consuming. I don't have much time anymore due to personal reasons ex. the fact I probably have a full time job soon
>
>The host itself currently doesn't earn anything, we primarily operate through startup funds & credits. Subsequently Altare will spend $80,000/mo on hardware and operational costs next month and Altare 8 is on time for release
>
>For me, despite the host being the largest in it's segment of the industry, this is really just a project I like working on, I am not paid as the CEO. So for me, this is not a good source of income
>
>I still want to follow the promise I made in February of Altare being the forever free 24/7 host with no ads so don't expect me to ever resign or the host to shut down or change from it's current position

The primary goal for November/December is scaling up.
**{new Date(1760977879298).toLocaleString()}**  
>For Nov/Dec, the primary goal is 1. a completely refactored backend stack and new console and 2. to scale up to ~$130,000/mo in compute so that we have at minimum 220 nodes
>

### Update coming soon or something
**{new Date(1760199016501).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone The next console update will be later, and then a major one tomorrow 
>
>All performance issues will be fixed finally, as clustering will be fully functional 
>
>- **Introducing Altare AI**
>
>We are launching many new AI and developer focused products including the Altare Arc 4 family, Altare AI Gateway & SDK powered by Altare edge inference, powered by our own TPUs and inference machines 
>
>The Arc 4 family is multimodal, trained on text, video, audio. Our largest, flagship model Arc 4 Max is the first SOTA (or close to) model from Altare. The whole family of models is the strongest in coding and agentic use we’ve ever had, with Altare Arc 4 (Thinking) beating Claude Sonnet 4.5 in most agentic tasks. The base model is a full fine tune, and includes new data from Parabola 3
>
>All models are unified under our AI Gateway, with access to over 30+ open source models running on our fast inference alongside Arc, with external OpenAI and Anthropic models coming soon too. Our TS SDK for Altare AI will be available next week too plus some other nice things we’ve been working on at the host side  
>
>- **Introducing Altare KV1**
>
>We have quite a lot of experience with key value databases considering since 2020 our dashboard has completely relied on it. I accidentally made an extremely fast regional key value database in Rust while experimenting so we’re turning it into a service. It will be completely free for your first billion queries
>
>- **New unified billing**
>
>Coins will be renamed to Credits and remain exactly how they are. Now we will also introduce account balance in either USD, GBP or EUR. Each month, in order to give our normal users access to our paid services, you will have a quota and be able to convert some of your credits to account balance to try Arc, AI Gateway/SDK, KV1, etc. Gems will be moved to be specifically under the free hosting, and so will most economy features. We may use credits for other services in the future that would be offered for free 
>
>Invoices for paid services are automatically issued on the 1st of each month and will automatically take from your account balance. There is quota and a negative balance limit to prevent abuse
>

### Console clustering
**{new Date(1760305790195).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone The console is now at least 10x faster
>
>All requests are now routed between two different console instances (plato and aristotle), and then it is routed between 4 different panel API instances (eistein, hawking, curie, tesla)
>
>This is between two different FRA regions in the event of an outage, it will fall back to the other region. And it's significantly faster than before
>

### Foundry brand announcement
**{new Date(1761744462658).toLocaleString()}**  
>Altare, Sryzen, Foundry and ZTL will merge to form the new Foundry brand. We will have another announcement later
>

### Question
**{new Date(1761915145897).toLocaleString()}**  
Would you all rather just 4-5 locations and a very high performance and stable service?

<details>
<summary>Original Messages</summary>

>@everyone for altare 8, which will probably just become foundry free hosting or something;

>would you all rather just 4-5 locations (nyc, london, frankfurt, singapore, something else) and a very high performance and stable service? the absolute best possible performance we could offer and likely multiple months of 100% uptime

_Yeah Altare 8 was not called foundry free hosting_

>the economy would need to be limited a lot to prevent the disaster of altare 7's economy but its possible

### Heliactyl 15 is "generally available"
**{new Date(1762177454648).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone Heliactyl Next 15 reaches general availability / stable release on 19 November. I promise Altare 8 before then as we’ve always ran the developer preview version of our software in production
>

</details>

### Foundry announcement
**{new Date(1762213940664).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone 
>
>**Everything is going to become integrated under the Foundry brand**
>
>The Discord server isn't entirely set up yet nor have we got boosts for it, but everyone will soon be autojoined and moved here: https://discord.gg/9MCWSMYTwW
>
>Next week, we're launching our NeoProtect alternative called AltProtect, and the Foundry AI console, with Altare 8, Heliactyl Next 15 this month too. Everything is likely going to make use of specialised Foundry Arc 4 AI models where possible, with as much of our software unified as possible
>

>A notice: Foundry's Discord only has our open source software available right now. It will be updated for Altare & all our other things soon
>

### Altare 8 features
**{new Date(1762438834792).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone
>
>- a completely rebuilt console from the ground up with a new UI + light/dark mode, no more freezing up and constantly outages
>- a much more fun economy with a better leaderboard and transaction system
>- a new service called Altare Pay which lets you pay for many other things (10+ launch partners) with your Altare balance
>- a points system so you get rewards for spending your balance
>- a whole new plans system and a new Altare Plus system with way more benefits than the old Altare Pro
>- ability to upgrade and buy things with actual money instead of using one of the (unfortunately) many black markets 🤣
>- way more nodes per location and much better performance
>- new coupons system for free coins and we'll hide them around the place. perhaps `THISISTHEFIRSTCOUPON` will work after launch (:
>- ai chat is back now with the Arc 4.1 family of models
>- sftp credentials and everything actually make sense now and the whole console isn't the most inconsistent thing ever
>- referrals 2.0 where it actually shows who you invited and you get extra if they actively use the host
>- *there's loads more that's just what i can remember off the top of my head*
>
>how does that sound for altare 8? or not enough

>Good morning.
>I wanted to take a moment to follow up regarding the previous announcement on Altare 8 as we continue preparing it for release. Development is progressing nicely; we're currently focusing on ensuring our new console and infrastructure are as stable and secure as they are fast. We are taking the time to get this right.
>
>That said, we recognize one of the biggest challenges we currently face is abuse.
>Over the past few weeks, we've seen a heavy increase in bots and malicious users on our platform. Incidents such as these can and have caused instability and downtime, so fighting this is our top priority. We are upping our verification systems, improving our monitoring, and constantly expanding to keep Altare reliable for genuine users.
>
>As for me, to those who may or may not already know me - I have recently joined Altare as Chief Operating Officer, and I will personally be overseeing all operations and community improvements.
>Over the coming days, I'll be going through every suggestion you've shared. If you haven't already posted any suggestions, now is the perfect time to. I'd love to hear what you want to see in Altare next.

### Pterodactyl deprecation
Pterodactyl was finally deprecated.

<details>
<summary>Original Message</summary>

**{new Date(1762704708982).toLocaleString()}**  
>@here Just a note for new Altare: the Pterodactyl panel has been deprecated and it will be shut down on January 1, 2026. Accounts that originally registered for Altare after July 1, 2025 will no longer be able to access the panel on Altare 8
>

**{new Date(1762704818347).toLocaleString()}**  
>The Pterodactyl panel is a huge contribution to our instability issues and we would rather only expose the API. As more and more features are built directly into Heliactyl and our Cryogenic daemon moves further away from supporting Pterodactyl, it becomes more difficult to maintain support

### Altare Ads
Matt asks if it would be fine if altare had non obtrusive ads provided by their Altare Ads platform

<details>
<summary>Original Message</summary>

**{new Date(1762713032577).toLocaleString()}**  
>@everyone Would you all be fine with Altare having ads? They would be non obtrusive, powered by our own in-house Altare Ads platform and be dismissible. It wouldn't cover any part of the console so you can use everything as normal
>
>We would have a publisher platform to allow people to use our ads network, and we will partner with as many hosts as we can to offer them access to our ads network to publish on it or have ads shown on their sites
>
>We have found a lot of interest and a few launch partners for this. If you're a host, any sort of site or someone who wants to run ads on our network, please DM me if interested
>

>This means we could expand our infrastructure and have potentially 4x the amount of nodes, able to pay our staff in the future if this expands well, so on
>We are already beginning to build the economy that will power the free hosting industry, with a unified economy network and Altare Pay
>
>This would launch alongside it to help fund what we want to build

>
>Altare 8 is the **biggest update we've ever had**. In 7 years, we have never replaced our original codebase in it's entirety and been successful at it. We have never had such a stable, well designed and fast console before, nor have we ever had as many features as we do now. 
>
>Everything works seamlessly. The console, file manager, everything just loads almost instantly, even at high demand and scale. We have both dark and light mode now and the whole console and brand has been redesigned.
>
>Subusers has been deprecated in favor of Tenants. All of your credits (formerly coins), servers, resources and so on are housed under your tenant, and you can invite members to it to manage it. Now if you're running a server, your other team members can earn credits and upgrade the server, so on or do anything that you could do.
>
>There's lots more, including both Google & Discord OAuth, our ads platform, things via emails actually working, full tenant & account wide audit logs, so on.

### Updated economy
- 0.35 credits per minute on AFK page
- 85 credits for you per referral, 350 for the user who signed up
- If your referral code is used in checkout when buying credits, you also earn 40% of it
- 30-95 credits per day (more via streak per usual)
- Invites/boosts unknown right now, invites may stay the same
- Decreased store prices

**{new Date(1762944404842).toLocaleString()}**  
>Hi @everyone
>
>We will be changing the way our economy works for the most part. Until now, the most profitable and easiest way to earn was via the AFK page. However, this does not make sense as the AFK page earns us nothing. Currently, our goal is to offer the best possible services in the long term and keep our promise of providing high performance free 24/7 hosting. To do this, we would like to begin turning a profit by the end of the year

>The updates rates are:
>- 0.35 credits per minute on AFK page
>- 85 credits for you per referral, 350 for the user who signed up
>- If your referral code is used in checkout when buying credits, you also earn 40% of it
>- 30-95 credits per day (more via streak per usual)
>- Invites/boosts unknown right now, invites may stay the same
>
>It's not that huge of a change as the store prices have also decreased and the economy is a lot more balanced. And we also expect performance to increase by a very noticeable amount, even on Asia locations, likely more than the industry standard
